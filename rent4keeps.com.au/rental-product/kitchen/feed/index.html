				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Key Features</strong><br />
11 Bread And Dough Modes<br />
100% Gluten Free Bread Mode<br />
3 Different Loaf Sizes</p>
<p><strong>Panasonic&#8217;s top-rated bread makers can now make jam and compote</strong><br />
Customers throughout the world love the Panasonic range of bread makers. They are consistently rated #1 in bread maker comparisons and receive glowing praise for their quality and reliability. Our previous bread maker model is the top customer rated product on the Panasonic Australia website and now we are excited to introduce a new model packed with even more great features. The SD-2501 will win Aussie hearts with its easy operation and impressive baking variety.</p>
<p><strong>Make the bread and the spread</strong><br />
You can get creative by using the Jam and Compote Mode to make your own delicious fruit spreads. Just imagine warm bread, spread with fresh home-made strawberry jam or compote! With 13 versatile baking programs at your fingertips, the SD-2501 is sure to be a hit with the whole family. Included in the great range of options is a Specialty Mode to make spelt bread as well as a Gluten Free Mode which makes baking gluten free bread very simple.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh bread whenever you want it<br />
</strong>The SD-2501 boasts a large capacity automatic raisin and nut dispenser that allows these additional ingredients to be added at the correct time and evenly distributed, eliminating the issues many home cooks face of fruit and nuts dropping to the bottom of the loaf. You can choose from three different crust colours and loaf sizes, perfectly tailoring the bread to your liking. The best part is that you can enjoy just-baked, warm bread whenever you like, thanks to the invaluable 13 hour digital timer.</p>
<p><strong>Easy to use, even easier to clean</strong><br />
Panasonic’s unique Diamond-Fluro coated bread pan and kneading blade stops your bread from sticking to the pan. Not only does this make it easy to remove the loaf at the end of the baking cycle, it also makes cleaning the unit a breeze.</p>
