				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The all new S Pen</strong><br />
The all new S Pen now boasts powerful Bluetooth technology, letting you press a button to take control of your camera, presentations and more without touching your phone. While drawing, taking notes, and sending Live Messages is as intuitive and natural as pen and paper, thanks to the fine tip and true-to-life pressure sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>Super-fast downloads</strong><br />
Discover what you can achieve on the Galaxy Note9. Whether gaming, streaming, or multitasking, the 10nm processor and 6GB RAM models deliver performance that makes you take notice. And with access to lightning fast network speeds, things get done in a flash.</p>
<p><strong>Long lasting battery</strong><br />
Leave your battery packs and cords at home — the 4000mAh battery is designed to get you through your day.</p>
<p><strong>See more, do more</strong><br />
Enjoy an uninterrupted view on our largest Infinity Display ever. Its virtually bezelless display gives you an expansive edge-to-edge cinematic experience as boundless as your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Stunning photos, day or night</strong><br />
Our Dual Aperture lens intelligently adapts to the surrounding light like the human eye — choosing between two f-stop modes. F1.5 mode brings in light to brighten up super low light shots. While F2.4 mode helps make sure your photos come out clear.</p>
<p><strong>True to life colours</strong><br />
Designed so you get the photo you want in the first shot. Scene Optimiser on the rear camera intelligently detects the subject in frame. It then chooses from twenty different modes like flowers, food, and more, and enhances the picture to suit your subject.</p>
<p><strong>Picture perfect</strong><br />
Eradicate closed eyes and blurry photos with Galaxy Note9&#8217;s Flaw Detection. It intelligently detects blinks, blurs, smudged lenses, and backlighting, notifying you so you can adjust and reshoot.</p>
<p><strong>More space for everything</strong><br />
Stop deleting your memories for just a little extra space. With the power of 128GB* storage built in &#8211; you’ll have room for what matters. And adding even more is simple; just place a microSD card in the slot for up to 400GB of extra space. So you can keep your files and photos right where you need them — on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Make a splash</strong><br />
For most phones, water is the enemy. The Galaxy Note9 and S Pen are sealed from the inside out with an IP68 rating to protect your phone from dust and water.</p>
<p><strong>It’s like two phones in one<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s always handy to have an option, whether it&#8217;s more storage or an extra phone number. With Hybrid SIM, keep your important files, photos, and videos with a MicroSD card, or use a second SIM to give you the freedom to have two phone numbers.*</p>
<p><strong>Leave your computer behind</strong><br />
DeX is designed to give you what you want from a PC experience. Just connect your phone into an external display to use apps, review documents, and watch videos on a PC-like interface. So you can turn any place into a workplace.</p>
<p><strong></p>

<p><strong>Wireless PowerShare</strong><br />
The superpower to share power is now yours. Galaxy S10e&#8217;s long-lasting intelligent battery is designed to use power so efficiently; you may have extra to share with friends. So when your friend needs a little more battery to call that ride share after the concert, you could save their day with a device-to-device recharge—no wires or outlets required.
