				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Key Features</strong></span></p>
<p>AI enhanced 25MP Front Camera<br />
6GB RAM and 128GB Storage<br />
6.4&#8243; Large Screen</p>
<p>Inspired by light and water, the R17 is designed to mesmerise. Stunning light effects dance across every inch of the R17’s surface thanks to the light condensation layered body. When you tap the screen, it bursts to life in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Gradient, Let your differences shine</strong><br />
We’re always excited when we find unique ways to combine colour and light to produce awe-inspiring effects. This has led to some truly unique colour options for the OPPO R17, each with a stunning interplay between light and shade. Choose between moody Ambient Blue and metropolitan Neon Purple.</p>
<p><strong>Waterdrop Screen. Life in watercolor</strong><br />
Water is life. The unique shape of the R17’s notch is inspired by a droplet of water captured at the moment before it falls; a brief, transitional state between movement and stillness, where anything is possible. When you turn on the screen, it bursts into life as if infused with the reinvigorating power of water.</p>
<p><strong>Define yourself on your own terms, with the 25MP AI Beauty Camera</strong><br />
When it comes to selfies, you’re the expert on all the best ways to bring out your natural beauty. That’s why the R17’s AI Beauty Camera lets you take control. Featuring face slimming, makeup and six other fully configurable modes as well as a live preview option, the AI Beauty Camera lets you decide what goes into the making of a perfect shot. At the same time, it learns your beauty tricks from the settings you use, so that the more you use your camera, the better it gets at taking photos.</p>
<p><strong>A rear camera smart enough to take your breath away</strong><br />
Special moments deserve to be captured. The R17’s AI-enhanced dual rear camera lets you create stunning portrait photographs through natural layering. Plus, it can recognise 23 different types of scenes and up to 864 combinations, fine-tuning the settings according to the unique requirements of each photo. Whether it’s a person or a scene, the R17 helps you do it justice and capture it in great clarity and detail.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Fingerprint Unlock, Unlock instantly from your display</strong><br />
You can unlock your R17 instantly just by touching the screen thanks to its hidden fingerprint sensor. An ultra-photosensitive sensor under the display ensures crystal-clear fingerprint images.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-lane performance with 6GB RAM + 128GB ROM</strong><br />
The combination of a generous 6GB RAM plus a Qualcomm 10 nm mobile processor unleashes the full operating potential of the R17 and boosts app opening speeds. Plus, we’ve optimised the system to work seamlessly for your immersive gaming pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Charge for five minutes. Use for two hours.</strong><br />
With VOOC flash charge, the R17’s large 3500mAh battery can reach full charge quickly and safely, thanks to the five-core protection which lets you use the phone freely while charging. VOOC Flash Charge is always dependable when you’re in need and once discovered it is something you can’t do without.</p>
<p><strong>ColorOS 5.2 Smarter means more useful and efficient</strong><br />
ColorOS 5.2 is the latest version of OPPO’s smart and efficient operating system and user interface. Also with the newly added Smart Bar, you can navigate between your favourite apps and features more freely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The all new S Pen</strong><br />
The all new S Pen now boasts powerful Bluetooth technology, letting you press a button to take control of your camera, presentations and more without touching your phone. While drawing, taking notes, and sending Live Messages is as intuitive and natural as pen and paper, thanks to the fine tip and true-to-life pressure sensitivity.</p>
<p><strong>Super-fast downloads</strong><br />
Discover what you can achieve on the Galaxy Note9. Whether gaming, streaming, or multitasking, the 10nm processor and 6GB RAM models deliver performance that makes you take notice. And with access to lightning fast network speeds, things get done in a flash.</p>
<p><strong>Long lasting battery</strong><br />
Leave your battery packs and cords at home — the 4000mAh battery is designed to get you through your day.</p>
<p><strong>See more, do more</strong><br />
Enjoy an uninterrupted view on our largest Infinity Display ever. Its virtually bezelless display gives you an expansive edge-to-edge cinematic experience as boundless as your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Stunning photos, day or night</strong><br />
Our Dual Aperture lens intelligently adapts to the surrounding light like the human eye — choosing between two f-stop modes. F1.5 mode brings in light to brighten up super low light shots. While F2.4 mode helps make sure your photos come out clear.</p>
<p><strong>True to life colours</strong><br />
Designed so you get the photo you want in the first shot. Scene Optimiser on the rear camera intelligently detects the subject in frame. It then chooses from twenty different modes like flowers, food, and more, and enhances the picture to suit your subject.</p>
<p><strong>Picture perfect</strong><br />
Eradicate closed eyes and blurry photos with Galaxy Note9&#8217;s Flaw Detection. It intelligently detects blinks, blurs, smudged lenses, and backlighting, notifying you so you can adjust and reshoot.</p>
<p><strong>More space for everything</strong><br />
Stop deleting your memories for just a little extra space. With the power of 128GB* storage built in &#8211; you’ll have room for what matters. And adding even more is simple; just place a microSD card in the slot for up to 400GB of extra space. So you can keep your files and photos right where you need them — on your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Make a splash</strong><br />
For most phones, water is the enemy. The Galaxy Note9 and S Pen are sealed from the inside out with an IP68 rating to protect your phone from dust and water.</p>
<p><strong>It’s like two phones in one<br />
</strong>It&#8217;s always handy to have an option, whether it&#8217;s more storage or an extra phone number. With Hybrid SIM, keep your important files, photos, and videos with a MicroSD card, or use a second SIM to give you the freedom to have two phone numbers.*</p>
<p><strong>Leave your computer behind</strong><br />
DeX is designed to give you what you want from a PC experience. Just connect your phone into an external display to use apps, review documents, and watch videos on a PC-like interface. So you can turn any place into a workplace.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Key Features</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">5.8&#8243; Infinity Display with QuadHD+ resolution</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">12MP Dual Pixel Camera with 8MP front camera</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Water and dust resistant (IP68)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Exynos 9 Octa-Core Chip</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">64GB* storage with microSD support</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Secure Iris Scanner technology</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">LTE Cat.16 (1050mbps)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">See what’s possible, when nothing gets in the way. The powerful new Galaxy S8 has a stunning Infinity Display that’s all screen from edge to edge. It has our best cameras ever and is sealed from the inside for true water resistance. We’ve never made anything quite like it.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Samsung Galaxy S8 provides ingress protection (IP68) against dust and water to a maximum of 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes. See http://www.samsung.com/au/pdf/IP68.pdf1 for details regarding proper care/use of device.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Now this is full screen<br />
</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">All screen from edge to edge, our stunning new Super AMOLED Infinity Display lets nothing get in the way. The 5.8-inch display on the Galaxy S8 and 6.2-inch on the Galaxy S8+ are not just big, they’re also our highest resolution smartphone screens yet*. So now you can see more, do more, and experience more, in a whole new way.</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Screen measured diagonally as a full rectangle without accounting for rounded corners.</span></p>

</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">With advanced cameras front and back, your life has never looked so good. The all-new, 8MP front-facing camera has smart auto-focus so selfies look sharp and absolutely stunning. On the rear camera, Dual Pixel technology can cut auto-focus time to as little as 0.2 seconds to catch quick movements. And the F1.7 lens and large 1.4μm pixels help give you crisp, clear shots, even in low light. Beautiful, time after time.</span><br />
