				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Key Features</strong></span></p>
<p>AI enhanced 25MP Front Camera<br />
6GB RAM and 128GB Storage<br />
6.4&#8243; Large Screen</p>
<p>Inspired by light and water, the R17 is designed to mesmerise. Stunning light effects dance across every inch of the R17’s surface thanks to the light condensation layered body. When you tap the screen, it bursts to life in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Magical Gradient, Let your differences shine</strong><br />
We’re always excited when we find unique ways to combine colour and light to produce awe-inspiring effects. This has led to some truly unique colour options for the OPPO R17, each with a stunning interplay between light and shade. Choose between moody Ambient Blue and metropolitan Neon Purple.</p>
<p><strong>Waterdrop Screen. Life in watercolor</strong><br />
Water is life. The unique shape of the R17’s notch is inspired by a droplet of water captured at the moment before it falls; a brief, transitional state between movement and stillness, where anything is possible. When you turn on the screen, it bursts into life as if infused with the reinvigorating power of water.</p>
<p><strong>Define yourself on your own terms, with the 25MP AI Beauty Camera</strong><br />
When it comes to selfies, you’re the expert on all the best ways to bring out your natural beauty. That’s why the R17’s AI Beauty Camera lets you take control. Featuring face slimming, makeup and six other fully configurable modes as well as a live preview option, the AI Beauty Camera lets you decide what goes into the making of a perfect shot. At the same time, it learns your beauty tricks from the settings you use, so that the more you use your camera, the better it gets at taking photos.</p>
<p><strong>A rear camera smart enough to take your breath away</strong><br />
Special moments deserve to be captured. The R17’s AI-enhanced dual rear camera lets you create stunning portrait photographs through natural layering. Plus, it can recognise 23 different types of scenes and up to 864 combinations, fine-tuning the settings according to the unique requirements of each photo. Whether it’s a person or a scene, the R17 helps you do it justice and capture it in great clarity and detail.</p>
<p><strong>Hidden Fingerprint Unlock, Unlock instantly from your display</strong><br />
You can unlock your R17 instantly just by touching the screen thanks to its hidden fingerprint sensor. An ultra-photosensitive sensor under the display ensures crystal-clear fingerprint images.</p>
<p><strong>Fast-lane performance with 6GB RAM + 128GB ROM</strong><br />
The combination of a generous 6GB RAM plus a Qualcomm 10 nm mobile processor unleashes the full operating potential of the R17 and boosts app opening speeds. Plus, we’ve optimised the system to work seamlessly for your immersive gaming pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>Charge for five minutes. Use for two hours.</strong><br />
With VOOC flash charge, the R17’s large 3500mAh battery can reach full charge quickly and safely, thanks to the five-core protection which lets you use the phone freely while charging. VOOC Flash Charge is always dependable when you’re in need and once discovered it is something you can’t do without.</p>
<p><strong>ColorOS 5.2 Smarter means more useful and efficient</strong><br />
ColorOS 5.2 is the latest version of OPPO’s smart and efficient operating system and user interface. Also with the newly added Smart Bar, you can navigate between your favourite apps and features more freely.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><br />
Key Features</strong></p>
<p>6.2&#8243; HD+ Waterdrop screen (1520 by 720 pixels)<br />
Qualcomm Snapdragon 450<br />
64GB storage 4GB RAM<br />
4230mAh battery<br />
Micro SD (expandable up to 256GB)<br />
13MP &amp; 2MP rear dual cameras (f/2.2 + f/2.4)<br />
16MP front camera (f/2.0)<br />
Bluetooth 4.2<br />
Dual nano sim<br />
ColorOS 5.2 (based on Android 8.1)</p>
<p><strong>Waterdrop Screen</strong><br />
AX7 adopts the industry-first waterdrop screen design, backed by several technological advances, reflecting nature like a water droplet on the verge of dropping. Plus, the robust corning glass supports an 89.4% screen ratio, providing resistance to scratches, while offering a more immersive experience.</p>
<p><strong>Stylish Color &#8211; Impressive at every angle</strong><br />
We apply the concept of contrasting beauty in aesthetics to product design, bringing together two on-trend colours, Glaring Gold &amp; Glaze Blue. A first in the industry, the 3D heat-curved sheet &amp; grating pattern on the back casing create a premium look, in harmony with the smooth feel of the central frame.</p>
<p><strong>Compacted Structure &amp; Comfortable handling</strong><br />
Anti-reflective coating is added to the AX7 to increase the overall screen brightness by 35% &#8211; the view is impressive from any angle you look at. Also, a low-voltage backlight reduces the phone temperature by 0.5 °C while a magnesium alloy allows the battery to dissipate heat more efficiently. All these efforts contribute to better performance and handling.</p>
<p><strong>4230mAh Battery &#8211; Get through the day with ease</strong><br />
A huge 4230mAh battery capacity frees you from the concern of battery drain during your day. In addition, smart and thoughtful AI battery management freezes inactive apps and reduces excess caching to save more power.</p>
<p><strong>Qualcomm Octa-core CPU</strong><br />
AX7 uses Qualcomm&#8217;s octa-core processor so that the system does not lag when you are immersed in a movie or game, and multitasking becomes faster and easier. Enhanced memory also empowers you to store more precious memories.</p>
<p><strong>16MP Front Camera</strong><br />
The 16MP front camera with HDR mode makes your selfies clearer even in harshly backlit conditions. Also, the wide angle and large aperture configuration capture extra details for more impressive photos.</p>
<p><strong>Dual Rear Camera &#8211; Shoot as an artist</strong><br />
The dual rear camera (13MP+2MP), together with AI beauty technology, offers studio-quality portraits with an even more accurate bokeh effect to make you stand out like a star. In addition to photos, the multi-frame image stabilisation technology makes your videos more fluid and vivid.</p>
<p><strong>AR Stickers  &#8211; Add fun to your photos</strong><br />
New music stickers and the option to add stickers in the foreground and background areas of images breathe new life into your photos, making them more interesting and fun.</p>
<p><strong>ColorOS 5.2 &#8211; Smart and Efficient</strong><br />
Based on Android 8.1, the upgraded ColorOS system provides a smarter, more efficient and convenient user experience, be it the Smart Bar which supports multi-tasking operations or Music on Display which offers a more immersive experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
